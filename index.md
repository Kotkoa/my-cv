### ABOUT ME

Frontend Developer with 6 years of experience developing web applications, focusing on the Front-end side with JS and React. I've worked on projects primarily from the USA, and Singapore, participating in worldwide teams.

I enjoy creating visually accurate website layouts, and translating designers' concepts from Figma into JSX code for React applications. I have extensive experience with fields and forms, starting from collecting user data (e.g., JSON-Forms), through validation (e.g., Yup), to submitting it to the server (REST, GraphQL API).

Currently, I am seeking remote employment opportunities with teams from the USA or Europe, or local opportunities in and around Valencia, Spain. Open to various employment forms, including full-time positions, contract work, or B2B arrangements.
