### ABOUT ME

With over 4 years of experience as a Frontend Developer Contractor, I have honed my skills in a diverse array of technologies and tools, including React, TypeScript, Apollo GraphQL, Jest, Material-UI, Styled CSS, Storybook, Yup, Jotai, and JSON-Forms. My journey in the tech industry spans over a decade, marked by a passion for crafting seamless, visually appealing, and user-centric digital products. This journey encompasses not only my current expertise in frontend development but also a 5-year tenure in a Project Manager role, bringing my total tech experience to over 10 years with a focus on design and web technologies.

In my quest for new opportunities, I aim to leverage my professional and technical skills to find in a Frontend Developer position within an EU-based team.
As I continue to evolve in my IT adventure, I am eager to master git-CI, unit testing, and delve further into the modern capabilities of front-end CSS. My career thus far has been a testament to my ability to adapt, innovate, and lead in the ever-changing landscape of web technologies.
